Crucially, it applies statistical bias correction to account for the non-linear transformation of the error term (Jensen's Inequality), ensuring unbiased estimates on the original scale.\n\nCorrection Strategies\n\nThe function detects the transformation used and applies the appropriate correction:\n\n1. Log-Normal Correction (Exact): For logarithmic transformations (log(y)), it applies the analytical solution for the mean of a log-normal distribution (often called the Meyer or Baskerville correction): Ey = exp(hatz + sigma^22)\n\n2. Delta Method Correction (Approximate): For other non-linear transformations (e.g., 1/y, 1/√y), it employs the Second-Order Delta Method. This uses a truncated Taylor Series expansion to adjust for the curvature of the inverse function: Ey approx g(hatz) + frac12sigma^2 g(hatz)\n\nWhere:\n\nhatz is the prediction on the transformed scale (linear predictor).\ng(cdot) is the inverse transformation function.\nsigma^2 is the residual mean squared error (MSE) of the model.\n\nParameters\n\nmodel: An AllometricModel object containing the fitted regression parameters, formula, and residual variance.\n\nReturns\n\nVector{Float64}: The predicted values on the original scale of y, adjusted for transformations and corrected for bias.\n\nReferences\n\nBaskerville, G.
